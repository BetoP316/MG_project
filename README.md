## 📌 Project Overview
In an economic landscape marked by **high uncertainty and rising default rates**, financial institutions need **predictive tools** to optimize debt recovery strategies. This study develops a **logistic regression model** enhanced by **machine learning techniques** to identify **high-risk clients** and refine collection strategies.

🔹 **Key Takeaways:**
✅ Predictive modeling **reduces collection costs** and improves efficiency 📉  
✅ Machine learning helps **prioritize high-risk debtors** 🎯  
✅ **Interest rates and installment size** are key factors affecting repayment probability 💰  
✅ Logistic regression and Random Forest models offer **97% accuracy** in default prediction 🔍

## 📊 Methodology & Approach

### **1️⃣ Data Collection**
We analyzed **credit portfolios, macroeconomic indicators, and socioeconomic factors** affecting debt repayment behavior.

📌 **Key Data Sources:**
- **Credit Portfolio Data** (Microgestión S.A.) 📑  
- **Macroeconomic Trends** (National Statistics) 📈  
- **Customer Socioeconomic Profiles** 👥  

| Data Type | Variables |
|------------|-----------|
| Customer Info | Age, Gender, Civil Status, Income Level |
| Loan Details | Interest Rate, Installment Amount, Credit Type |
| Economic Factors | Employment Rate, Industry Type, Inflation |

### **2️⃣ Predictive Modeling: Logistic Regression & Machine Learning**

We developed a **logistic regression model** to estimate **default probability**, minimizing **risk exposure** while improving collection efficiency.

📌 **Model Equation:**
```math
P(IMPAGO = 1 | X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\sum \beta_i X_i}}
```
*(Where \( X_i \) represents loan and customer characteristics affecting default probability.)*

🔹 **Key Features Impacting Default Risk:**
✅ **Interest on active & overdue installments** (22-24% impact on default probability)  
✅ **Installment capital amount** (Lower capital reduces default risk)  
✅ **Age & credit cycle** (New clients are higher risk)  

📊 **Performance Metrics:**

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Logistic Regression** | 97% ✅ | 94% | 95% |
| **Random Forest** | 90% | 91% | 89% |

📌 **Key Takeaway:** Machine learning models **enhance debt collection accuracy** by filtering high-risk clients.

## 🎯 Key Insights & Results

📌 **Main Findings:**
✅ Clients **with higher overdue interest rates** are at greater risk of default  
✅ **First-time borrowers have a 40% default rate**, while repeat borrowers have almost zero risk  
✅ **Clients in urban areas default more frequently** than rural borrowers  
✅ **Machine learning models improve risk identification by 10%** over traditional statistical models  

📊 **Chi-Square Tests confirm significant differences** between repayment behaviors across **age, credit cycle, and financial stability**.
